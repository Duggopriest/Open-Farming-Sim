# Open-Farming-Sim

This project is a way I can learn new coding methods and ideas as the idea of a farming game can cover many different types of systems. One system I have learned to do is to draw the games as efficiently as possible without compromising other systems.

One thing I want to work on is sheep herding where Ill use swarm theory and AI pathing using A*.
and I am going to impliment some shaders for some effects!
